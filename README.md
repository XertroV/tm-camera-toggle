# Camera Toggle

Controller button binding for toggling the camera between cam 1 and cam 2 (customizable).

Use the debug tab in settings to see what buttons are pressed if they don't line up with your controller.

There is a bug where, if you enter cam7, then the toggle won't work to bring you out of cam7. So you need to manually exit it.
